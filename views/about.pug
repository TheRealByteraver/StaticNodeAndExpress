        p Full Stack JavaScript Developer

        .about-bio
          p I've always loved to program. More specifically, I love to think about possible solutions for a given problem. For example, the challenges you can pick up from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.codewars.com/">codewars</a> are right up my alley ðŸ˜€<br>The webdevelopment industry is developing at breakneck pace. The amazing productivity of modern web technology makes it very appealing for application development, especially since your app or site will run on any device with a browser. I decided it was time to familiarize myself more with the environment and technology, so I did two full stack JavaScript bootcamps on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a>.<br>This gave me a solid foundation but I still felt that I needed more practice, and above all, feedback from a teacher or peers. That is where the Techdegree from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.teamtreehouse.com">Team Treehouse</a> comes in. It covers both frontend and backend JavaScript, including React. At the end, I was left with 10 projects to show off what I learned. Some of them are on this site.
