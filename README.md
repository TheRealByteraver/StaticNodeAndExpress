# Exceeds requirements description
The exceeds requirements have been fulfilled as described:
1. The app can be started with the 'npm start' command
2. Error handling has been implemented using the extra error.pug and page-not-found.pug views
3. The following CSS changes have been made:
    1) Project thumbnail animation: when the mouse hovers over a card, it gets a shadow and the cards slide a bit up to the top left, which makes it more visible that they are 'clickable' so to speak.
    2) Changed the sidebar colors (as a joke, they reflect the old borland ide default colors)
    3) Changed the font of the text in the sidebar
