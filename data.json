        "description": "An application showing data on solar panel yields, humidity levels, temperature, etc. It took some experimenting with the recharts library to get this one right. I recently implemented react router, but the people responsible for the backend still have to implement server side routing (I do not have access to the backend). In the future, we would like to also show realtime data. This needs a little more work on the backend side (to which I have no access). This was my first time using Tailwind, and while not perfect, I still really like it and will keep using it for other projects as well. Note that, for privacy reasons, there is no live link to the app. The Github repo is also private.",

Both frontend and backend include user authentication. The layout is quite barebone, as this was never intended to be an exercise in design or CSS.",

This taught me that MySQL will eat up half a gigabyte of RAM just sitting still. Fun times ;)",

I wrote this app to familiarize myself with Meteor.Js, which is used by Webship, a company that gave me my first experience as a full stack web developer. Meteor.Js is amazing for this type of real-time apps and allows for super fast prototyping. It needs quite some horsepower though, and might not be that easy to scale. This one is hosted on a free tier of galaxy.meteor.com, so it might take a while to load. You might need to refresh the browser after the initial load; after that it should work just fine.",
